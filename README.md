# Introduction

Once you have a network switch with two nodes on the same broadcast domain, you have a working network. There are a certain minimum of services we need active to make any network practical and usable.&#x20;

In this section of notes, I am going to consider the minimum services we include on every practical network.

These notes are based on GNS3, but you can carry these exercises out on real equipment, or in other emulated environments.
