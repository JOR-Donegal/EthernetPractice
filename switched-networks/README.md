# Switched Networks

I need a scenario to work against.

Let us assume we are building a network for an SME or school. We have three buildings with different purposes, and we need to come up with a design and configuration.

| Building | Purpose   | Nodes |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| 1        | Offices   | <48   |
| 2        | Warehouse | <24   |
| 3        | Shop      | <24   |
