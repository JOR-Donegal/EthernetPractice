# Discussion

In Cisco terminology, a trunked link is one where we pass tagged frames for VLANs.&#x20;

Beware!

In the introduction, I mentioned multiple proprietary techniques for use in data centres.

Do some background reading on Cisco's Multi-chassis EtherChannel (MCEC).

Also look at Dell's Virtual Link Trunking (VLT).

## Layer 3 Ether channels

The exercises in this sequence have all been on layer 2 networks. So far, we have not discussed routing. I am not going to go into too much detail here, but any interface can be assigned an IP address. An ether channel is just an interface and can be assigned an IP address. This makes our multichannel interface look like a routed interface.
