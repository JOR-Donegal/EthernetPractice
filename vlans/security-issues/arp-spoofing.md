# ARP Spoofing

We know about the ARP protocol and that anyone can claim to be the owner of any IP address within a specific subnet. It is impossible to jump across VLANs this way, but within the same VLAN, ARP poisoning or ARP spoofing attacks are an effective way to fool end stations or routers into learning counterfeited device identities. This allows a malicious user to pose as intermediary and perform a Man-In-the-Middle (MiM) attack
